Notes:

HAS-A relationships: A has a B, instantiate B in A

IS-A relationships: B is an A, B extends A

Store has to pass itself into each new register, make sure not to just
make a copy of store, it has to be the address of the actual Store

Create a generic class called SortedList.
It should sort itself and allow for search by ID number (UPC, cashierID, or transaction ID)
