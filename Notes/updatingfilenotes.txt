Here are the steps to implement file storage that this program uses
It is used for Product, Cashiers, Registers, and Transactions

1)Implement a method to write to a file 
	-These are towards the bottom of Store.java

2)Implement a method to read from a file
	-These are below the aforementioned methods in Store.java

3)Add an overloaded constructor to the class of each object being stored 
	-these accept an ID without using a generator like the previous constructors do

4)Modify the initial constructor of each class so it reads from and stores to a txt file
	-This is only used for the ID generator, so it doesn't reset to 0 every time the program is run

5)Find all instances where these classes are modified, include the write to file method after each

6)Find all instances where these classes are read, include the read from file method after each
