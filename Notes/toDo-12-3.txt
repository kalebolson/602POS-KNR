To Do list today:

First priority -
How does the sale process look?
How do register and transaction work together in this process?
Figure out how returns work from there


Other Priorities - 

Draw UI screens
Determine which medium to build UI with

Investigate storage via text files

I (Kaleb) currently have the money being handled as a double in Register.java
Do I need to change this to bigDecimal? does this matter?

Do we update pseudocode at this point
